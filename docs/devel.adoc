== Making a release

NOTE: This is a work in progress

.Update the changelog
* You can generate author list with where `<tag>` is replaced with previous release's tag:
+
    git log <tag>.. --format="%aN" --reverse | perl -e 'my %dedupe; while (<STDIN>) { print unless $dedupe{$_}++}' | sort

.Prepare release commit
* Update version in `setup.py`
* commit msg: Prepare %version% release
* You can optionally do a release commit (with `--allow-empty` if needed) msg: Release %version%

.Tag the release commit
* Annotated Tag msg: Version %version%

.Push your changes (don't forget the tag!)

.Make a release on github (from changelog and copy sections themes from previous releases)
* linkify issues with vim's: `%s/{uri-issue}\d\+\[#\(\d\+\)\]/#\1/gc`

.Post-release
* Update version in `setup.py` (+1 bugfix, append '.dev0') and commit
* commit msg: Begin development on next release
